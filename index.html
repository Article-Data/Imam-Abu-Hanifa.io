<h1 style="color:Gold; font-size:40px; text-align:center;"> <b> <u> IMAM ABU HANIFAH </u> </b> </h1> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size:20px; text-align:center;"> <b> Al-Numan bin Thabit, commonly known as Abu Hanifah <br>
is considered as the Founder of Hanafi school of thought - one of the Four Schools or Rights of Islamic legal knowledge (Fiqh) within the Sunni Schools of Law. <br>
He got the Title of Abu Hanifah because he was someone who diligently do worship Allah and earnestly do obligations in religion because the words 
"Hanif" in Arabic means "Inclined" to the true religion. <br>
He is also widely known as Al-Imam Al-Azam (The Great Imam) &
Siraj Al-Aimma (The Lamp of the Imams). 
</b> </p> <br>


<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 20px;"> Abu Hanifah Al-Numan bin Thabit bin Zuta bin Marzuban was born in Kufa, Iraq in 80 AH (After Hijrat). <br>
He was one of well known Persian merchants. Abu Hanifah grew up in his hometown of Kufa and was educated there and lived most of his early life there
except for periodic Pilgrimages(Hajj) and scholarly visits to Makkah, Madinah and other centers of learning. Under his father's paternal  direction, 
Abu Hanifah memorized the Quran. He grew in Kufa, first as a student, then a merchant, then as a teacher and finally an expert of Islamic Jurisprudence(Fiqh).
</p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 20px;"> Abu Hanifah was amongst the Tabieen. There are various differing quotes concerning the number of (Sahabas) Companions of 
Prophet Muhammad(S.A.W) seen by Imam Abu Hanifah. However it is confirmed that Imam Abu Hanifah had met with some Sahabas who were still living at that time.
Some of the Sahabas he had met with includes: <br>
Anas bin Malik(Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu) in Basra. <br>
Abu Tufail ibn Waasila(Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu) in Makkah. <br>
Abdullah ibn Abu Afwa(Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu) in Kufa. <br>
Suhayl ibn Saad Saidi(Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu) in Madinah. <br>
</p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 20px;"> Imam Abu Hanifah followed in the family's trade (Silk Cloth Merchant) and quickly establishing a reputation for 
honesty and fairness. Once, he sent his partner, Hafs ibn Abdur-Rahman to sell some cloths at a distant market.
He pointed out a defect in the cloth and instructed him to disclose it to the buyer when he sold it and so price the cloth accordingly. <br>
Hafs sold the cloth however he forgot to point out the defect and to add insult to injury, he could not remember the identity of the purchaser.
Faced with the predicament of holding unjust profit, Abu Hanifah decided to forego the entire amounts of transaction i.e. Thirty Thousand Dirhams
(Both basic price and profit) and donated the proceeds to the Poor.
</p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 20px;"> Abu Hanifah first dedicated himself to the Study of Theology(Kalam). <br>
After Mastering Theology, Abu Hanifah pursued the Study of Islamic legal knowledge(Fiqh) in Kufa which was considered the center of famous fiqh scholars. <br>
Abu Hanifa studied fiqh from Hammad ibn Sulaiman who was most knowledgable teacher at the time. Abu Hanifah used to read every day from Hammad ibn Sulaiman,
between Maghrib and Isha. Whenever he got free time, he used to go to Hammad's House. Hammad remained to be Abu Hanifah's teacher for 18 years. <br>
After the death of Hammad ibn Sulaiman, the scholars of Kufa Madarsah agreed to appoint Abu Hanifah as the head of the Madarsah.
</p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 20px;"> After completing his education at Kufa and Basrah, Abu Hanifa went to Makkah and Madinah as the center of religious teachings of Islam. <br>
In Makkah, he learned hadith from Ata ibn Raba who was also the student of Abdullah ibn Abbas(Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu). He educated Abu Hanifah with great care
and attention. Imam Abu Hanifah was taught by almost 4000 teachers. The exact number of teachers of Abu Hanifah is unknown as he traveled a lot to different cities to 
gain religious knowledge. He performed Hajj 55 times. <br>
Imam Abu Hanifah had thousands of students. Twenty-eight of Imam Abu Hanifa's students became judges in different towns, cities and provinces and Eight became Imams.
</p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 20px;"> Imam Abu Hanifah was offered various posts, including Chief treasurer and Chief Judge(Qadhi) by the Khalifa Marwan bin Muhammad 
and the Governor of Iraq Province Umar ibn Hubayra Al-Fazar but Abu Hanifa refused all these offers. <br>
Abu Jafar Abdullah bin Mohammad Al-Mansur - The Ruler of that time offered Imam Abu Hanifah the post of Chief Judge(Qadhi). He refused the offer because he knew 
if he was to become the Qadhi, he would never be able to pass Fair Judgements because the Khalifa would pressurenhim to his own desire. In his refusal letter to 
Mohamad Al-Mansur, Abu Hanifah said that he was not fit for the post. <br>
Al-Mansur who had his own ideas and reasons for offering the post, lost his temper and accused Abu Hanifa for lying.
</p> <br>

<p style="color:Gold; font-size: 20px;"> Abu Hanifa's response did not sit well with Mohammad Al-Mansur. Abu Hanifah was punished by imprisonment and flogging. <br>
He kept talking about the corruption done by the Government. The Government got so annoyed and they poisoned his Food. He died at the age of 70 in Baghdad in the year 767. <br>
Imam Abu Hanifah passed away in the state of prostation(Sajda). When he died, he left instructions that he should not be buried in any land which the ruler had 
misappropriated. The whole town came out to pay their last homage to the greatest Imam of Islamic Law. It was said that so many people attended his Janazah(Funeral) that the 
Funeral Service was repeated 6 times for more than 50,000 people who had amassed before he was actually buried.
